<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or
  overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated
  in popular culture with a security hacker someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break
  into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be inaccessible to them  hacking can also be utilized by
  legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in
  order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using anonymity tools (such as a
  VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves.[1][2] Likewise, covert world
  agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work. On the other hand, hacking and
  cyber-attacks are used extra- and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless
  activities), and employed by state actors as a weapon of both legal and illegal warfare.

<p>Today, mainstream usage of "hacker" mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of the word since the 1990s.[5] This includes what hacker slang calls "script kiddies", people breaking into computers using programs written by others, with very little knowledge about the way they work. This usage has become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist.[6] While the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by calling security breakers "crackers" (analogous to a safecracker).</p>

<p>The controversy is usually based on the assertion that the term originally meant someone messing about with something in a positive sense, that is, using playful cleverness to achieve a goal. But then, it is supposed, the meaning of the term shifted over the decades and came to refer to computer criminals</p>
